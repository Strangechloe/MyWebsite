   <p>My name is Chloe Strange and I like to take pictures of random things. I use a photo camera to take my pictures and most of them
     are taken at my house. I also have a Fujifilm Instax Mini 7s and have taken pictures with that. The camera I use most of the time is the camera on an LG
     stylo 3 phone. The picture at the top is a picture of me and my neighbor's pig. I'm a high schooler right now and I'm learning Chinese but I'm not to good
     at it. The picture above was taken by my little sister. This is my first attempt at coding a website, so please have mercy. I don't want to become a
     professional photographer but an FBI Agent in the future. I have four pets, two parakeets and two dogs. One dog is a Yorkie and his name in Benedict or
     Benny of short. Well the other dog is a mix from what I can tell but I don't know what because the person my dad got him from said he was a Great Dane but
     he sure as heck isn't a Great Dane and his name is Coal. Also my dad got Coal from Craigslist.</p>
